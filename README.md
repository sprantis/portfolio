## Sarah Prantis's Portfolio Webpage

Deployed Link:
 [https://sprantis.github.io/portfolio/]

 Description:
 I have created my own professional portfolio webpage. The webpage displays my image, breathe of work (with placeholder images) and links to be able to contact me. There is a functioning navigation bar that allows users to select a section to scroll to. The first image has a click-able image that will load the deployed application after being selected. This page has a responsive layout for all device types.
